# 09 — Native ← Tauri parity roadmap (the remaining gap)

**Date:** 2026-06-06
**Branch:** `experiment/native-swift-liquid-glass`
**Mission:** bring native (SwiftUI, all Apple-native primitives) up to the Tauri
build's functionality. Tauri = source-of-truth spec; native = destination.

Derived from a full side-by-side feature sweep of both builds (Activity already
done, task 08). Items grouped into **bundles** ordered by leverage. Each item
lists the Tauri source and the native destination.

## STATUS — ALL BUNDLES LANDED (2026-06-06)
All six bundles implemented, built clean, committed + pushed on
`experiment/native-swift-liquid-glass`:
- A keyboard + ⌘K palette → `b9f5cfd`
- B vulnerability surfacing → `7f49aff`
- D enrichment / Discover → `21fb4a5`
- E upgrade sheet + GitHub detail → `8c54da4`
- F About / status row / toasts / window state → `7105733`
- C Sparkle self-updater → `f0f0d41`
**Only remaining = the two human-run Sparkle items** (real `SUPublicEDKey` + host
the appcast/zip on `brew-browser.zerologic.com`). See "Releasing native (Sparkle)"
at the bottom. Everything builds + functions today.

## Execution model
- **Single compiled codebase** → Swift edits are serialized (parallel edits to
  `AppModel.swift`/`ContentView.swift` would conflict + break the build).
- **Loop**: one item (or tight sub-group) per iteration → implement → `swift build`
  → fix → mark done → next. `native/build-app.sh` after each bundle.
- **Agent team + agents**: research/spec extraction from Tauri and design can fan
  out in parallel; the actual Swift edit + build is serialized by the orchestrator.
- Verify per bundle; user tests via screenshots. Commit per bundle.

## Bundle A — Keyboard shortcuts + Command palette (highest "native-pro" leverage)
Tauri: `src/routes/+page.svelte:46-128` (global keys), `CommandPalette.svelte`,
`Sidebar.svelte:35-43` (⌘0–6 map).
Native dest: new `Commands`/`CommandGroup` in `BrewBrowserApp.swift`; new
`CommandPaletteView.swift`; `AppModel` selection + drawer + refresh hooks.
- A1. Section nav ⌘0–6 (Dashboard…Activity) via `.commands` `CommandGroup`.
- A2. ⌘L toggle Activity drawer; global ⌘R refresh; ⌘⇧L cycle theme; `/` focus
  search; Esc chain (close inspector → palette).
- A3. **⌘K command palette** — sheet/overlay; sources: installed (top 8), index
  (`brew search`, debounced), commands (open sections, toggle drawer, refresh).
  Stock `.sheet` + `List` + `.searchable` or custom field. (Mirror
  `CommandPalette.svelte`.)

## Bundle B — Vulnerability surfacing (native scans; only shows it in detail)
Tauri: `Dashboard.svelte:818-912` (Exposure card), `Library.svelte` Vulnerable
pill + `PackageRow.svelte` severity dot, `Sidebar.svelte:165-194` vuln badge,
`PackageDetail.svelte:997-1138` (clickable advisory ids + Upgrade-to-fix).
Native dest: `AppModel` (scan-all + severity index), `DashboardView`,
`ContentView` Library filter, `PackageDetailView` security card.
- B1. **Scan-all** in AppModel (currently per-detail only) + a name→maxSeverity map.
- B2. Library "Vulnerable" filter pill (was deferred, `AppModel.swift:32-33`) +
  severity dot column on rows.
- B3. Dashboard **Exposure card** (per-severity counts, Scan now, View vulnerable).
- B4. Sidebar/section vuln badge (native sidebar = stock `.badge`; surface count).
- B5. Detail security card: clickable CVE/GHSA/OSV → canonical advisory; "Upgrade
  to fix" when installed < fixedIn.

## Bundle C — Self-updater (DECISION: **Sparkle**, 2026-06-06)
Tauri: `update/*` commands, `SettingsSectionUpdates.svelte`, `UpdateIndicator.svelte`.
User chose true in-app self-update via **Sparkle 2** (the standard for non-MAS
macOS apps; SwiftUI-compatible). MAS is out (sandboxing blocks shelling to brew).
- C1. Add Sparkle via SPM to `native/Package.swift`; create an updater controller
  (`SPUStandardUpdaterController`) wired into the app + a `Settings → Updates` tab
  (Check now / last-checked / auto-check daily) and a titlebar "update available"
  affordance (mirror `UpdateIndicator.svelte`).
- C2. `Info.plist`: `SUFeedURL` + `SUPublicEDKey` + `SUEnableAutomaticChecks`.
  Add an `appcast.xml` generation step (Sparkle `generate_appcast`).
- **Host (decided 2026-06-06): mirror the Tauri updater** — Tauri's updater feed
  is the PUBLIC domain `https://brew-browser.zerologic.com/updater.json`
  (`src-tauri/tauri.conf.json:34`), served by the same Caddy that fronts
  `/enrichment/*` + `/trending-history/*`. The private build-host IP appears in
  ZERO committed files; keep it that way. Sparkle mirror = same public host, new
  path:
  - `SUFeedURL` = `https://brew-browser.zerologic.com/appcast.xml` (public domain,
    safe to commit into Info.plist).
  - Artifacts: notarized `.app` zip under a sibling path on the same domain.
  - Caddy: one `handle_path /appcast.xml` + a static path for the zip, mirroring
    the existing trending/enrichment blocks.
- **BLOCKED on user (provision, can't be self-generated):**
  1. **Sparkle EdDSA keypair** via `generate_keys` — NOTE Tauri signs with
     minisign (its `tauri.conf.json` pubkey); Sparkle uses ed25519, so the key
     does NOT carry over. Public key → Info.plist `SUPublicEDKey`; private key
     stays in the login Keychain (never committed).
  2. Caddy path + actually hosting `appcast.xml` + the notarized zip on
     `brew-browser.zerologic.com`; and notarizing the `.app`.
  Build everything else with the public domain; leave the key + hosting as
  clearly-marked TODO placeholders.

## Bundle D — Enrichment / Discover
Tauri: `Discover.svelte` (tile grid, recent searches, stale banner),
`Dashboard.svelte:524-553` (catalog freshness strip), `PackageDetail.svelte`
"Wrong?" + `IssueModal.svelte`.
Native dest: `DiscoverView`, `DashboardView`, `PackageDetailView`, `AppModel`.
- D1. **"Wrong?" corrections** on enriched fields + categories → prefilled issue
  (reuse `ReportIssue.swift` pattern / device-flow issue sheet).
- D2. Discover **category tile grid** (icon/label/count) replacing/augmenting the
  current Picker; click → filter.
- D3. **Recent-searches** chips in Discover.
- D4. **Catalog-freshness strip** (Dashboard) + **stale-catalog banner** (Discover)
  with one-click "Refresh from brew.sh".

## Bundle E — Bulk actions + GitHub detail
Tauri: `UpgradeModal.svelte`, `PackageDetail.svelte:1215-1344` (GitHub card+actions).
Native dest: new `UpgradeSheet.swift`; `PackageDetailView` GitHub card; `GitHubService`.
- E1. **Curated upgrade sheet** ("Choose…") — multi-select outdated (pinned
  excluded), select/deselect all → `brew upgrade <names>`. Native "Choose…"
  currently just filters Library.
- E2. GitHub detail: **Unstar/Unwatch** toggle states (verify `GitHubService` has
  unstar/unwatch), **archived-repo** warning, **license-mismatch** warning.

## Bundle F — Minor / cosmetic (native-idiomatic equivalents; skip redundant)
- F1. **AboutModal** equivalent — native-idiomatic About (brand + version + donate
  + credits). Tauri has both Settings→About and a modal; native has only the tab.
  (Consider a custom About window or `.appInfo`.)
- F2. Sidebar **brew-status row** (health dot + label + click-to-reprobe).
- F3. **Toast system with action buttons** (e.g. "Re-authorize" scope-fix). Native
  uses macOS notifications; decide if an in-window transient is wanted.
- F4. Window size/position persistence (Tauri PR #17) — confirm not already covered
  by macOS state restoration; add `.defaultPosition`/scene storage if needed.
- (Skip: titlebar theme dropdown — Settings→Appearance already covers theme the
  native way.)

---

## Cross-cutting rules
- All native, stock SwiftUI/AppKit primitives; no chrome/material overrides.
- Reuse: `ReportIssue.swift`, `PackageIcon`/`KindPill`/`Chip`, the `startJob`
  engine, `AppSettings` gating helpers (`vulnerabilityScanningAllowed`,
  `githubAllowed`, `networkAllowed`, `aiFeaturesVisible`).
- Gate every network feature on Offline Mode + its toggle (mirror Tauri).
- No private host names in committed files.

## Releasing native (Sparkle)

Bundle C wired Sparkle 2 into the native build (`Package.swift` dep,
`UpdaterController.swift`, the Settings → Updates tab, the titlebar pill, and the
`SUFeedURL` / `SUPublicEDKey` / `SUEnableAutomaticChecks` / `SUScheduledCheckInterval`
keys in `build-app.sh`'s Info.plist).

**Done (2026-06-06):**
- ✅ **Keypair generated.** `generate_keys` run; the ed25519 PUBLIC key
  `OoRc2WZfiHX21nhhm/inmv5l282Ob97GBwx+fZoML/E=` is baked into `build-app.sh`'s
  `SUPublicEDKey` (committed — public by design). The PRIVATE key lives in the
  maintainer Mac's login Keychain (never committed). Tauri's minisign key does
  NOT carry over — Sparkle uses ed25519.
- ✅ **One-command release script** `native/release.sh`: build(release) →
  Developer ID sign (hardened runtime, inside-out incl. Sparkle.framework) → zip
  → `notarytool submit --wait` → staple → re-zip → `generate_appcast`
  (`--download-url-prefix https://brew-browser.zerologic.com/native/`) → `appcast.xml`.

**Operator steps to actually ship a release (need your Apple creds + host):**
1. Bump `CFBundleShortVersionString` + `CFBundleVersion` in `native/build-app.sh`.
2. `DEVELOPER_ID_APP="Developer ID Application: … (TEAMID)" NOTARY_PROFILE=<profile> native/release.sh`
   (create the notary profile once: `xcrun notarytool store-credentials …`).
   Outputs `native/dist/BrewBrowser-<ver>.zip` + `native/dist/appcast.xml`.
3. **Host (mirror the Tauri updater):** serve `appcast.xml` + the zip from
   `brew-browser.zerologic.com` behind the same Caddy that fronts `/enrichment/*`
   + `/trending-history/*`. The app's `SUFeedURL` is
   `https://brew-browser.zerologic.com/appcast.xml`; the zips sit under `/native/`.
   Add a block like (public domain only — no private host names anywhere):
   ```
   handle_path /appcast.xml      { root * $OUT_DIR; file_server }
   handle_path /native/*         { root * $OUT_DIR; file_server }
   ```
   then upload `native/dist/*` to `$OUT_DIR` (rsync/scp from local ops).

That's the whole loop: in-app updater is complete; a release is `release.sh` +
upload.

### Two update feeds — keep BOTH supported
The shipped Tauri build has its OWN updater that must keep working alongside the
native Sparkle feed. They are fully independent (different files, signing, and
artifact hosts) and coexist under the same Caddy root
(`/home/michael/Sites/brew-browser` on the build host — public domain only in
committed files):

| | Manifest (zerologic) | Signing | Artifacts |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tauri** | `/updater.json` | minisign (`tauri.conf.json` pubkey) | GitHub Releases (`createUpdaterArtifacts`) |
| **native** | `/appcast.xml` | Sparkle ed25519 (`SUPublicEDKey`) | `/native/*.zip` on zerologic |

A release that bumps the version must refresh the relevant feed(s): Tauri →
rebuild via `tauri build` (its action regenerates `updater.json` + uploads the
GitHub Release asset); native → `release.sh` + upload `appcast.xml` + the zip.
Never overwrite one feed's file with the other's — `/appcast.xml` ≠ `/updater.json`.

## Open questions for the user
1. **Self-updater (C)**: full Sparkle, or UI + notify only (defer real self-update)?
   → Resolved 2026-06-06: full Sparkle. Implemented in Bundle C.
2. Anything in **Bundle F** you'd rather skip as non-native?
