# Tasks — 2026-06

Per-task records for June 2026 work on brew-browser. Two parallel tracks this
month (per the parity charter — `decisions.md` 2026-06-01, memory
`project-parity-charter`): the shipped **Tauri** app on `main` and the **native**
macOS rebuild on `experiment/native-swift-liquid-glass`. Numbering is per-track;
filenames are prefixed `NN-tauri-*` / `NN-native-*` so they don't collide.

## Native track (`experiment/native-swift-liquid-glass`)

Native macOS build under `native/`.

## Context

The `experiment/native-swift-liquid-glass` rebuild (native macOS 26 app under
`native/`) raced ahead in a few areas, then the two builds were brought back into
feature/data-contract parity in both directions. Per the parity charter
(`decisions.md` 2026-06-01 + memory `project-parity-charter`), feature/data work
is kept in sync across the two shells; the memory-bank is the single canonical
spec for both. The Tauri track this month brought the shipped app up to the
native build's list/detail icons + Dashboard charts, one-prompt Keychain, and the
canonical Trending velocity threshold, plus the live-enrichment pipeline + app
(#41/#42/#43). The native track closed the reverse gap (Services, Activity,
GitHub, vulnerability surfacing) and finished with Sparkle self-update + the
"Brew Browser" rename ahead of deploy.
